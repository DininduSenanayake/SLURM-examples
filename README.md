# SLURM-examples

The purpose of this repository is to collect examples of how to run SLURM jobs on CSG clusters.
Students, visitors and stuff members are welcomed to use scripts from this repository in their work, and also contribute their own scripts.


If you want to share your SLURM script, then it is your responsibility to ensure that the script works and correctly allocates cluster resources.
